### COMMAND LINE MYSTERY
One of the ways that I learned about the command line was playing this mystery game where you have to navigate a bunch of files to find clues. (And I super enjoyed it because I'm a nerd)

Start by moving to your desktop: `cd ~/Desktop`

Next clone the game: `git clone https://github.com/veltman/clmystery.git`

Once it's downloaded change directory into the game: `cd clmystery`

Now, run `cat instructions` to read about how to play!
