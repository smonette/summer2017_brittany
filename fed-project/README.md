# Front-end Developer Homework problem

## YAY FUN PROJECT! :sparkles:

Your task is to turn this [sketch file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tsua2ouau8blqsn/Web_Dev_Exercise.sketch?dl=0) into a working HTML/Sass prototype! 

This is the sort of problem you'd be asked in a job interview for a front-end postion. (For real, I did this when I applied at MileIQ) You can use whatever tools you want, but I want to see the following:

- A Github repo for your project
- Meaningful commit messages
- A Readme with clear instructions on how your prototype works (and how I could get it running on my machine)
- A coded prototype
- Sass as a CSS pre-processor 
- Your prototype deployed to a live url


## Final Deliverables
- A URL to your public repo
- The URL to your site

## Not sure where to start?
1. Read the [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) documentation
2. Search for how to compile your Sass files into CSS
3. Review Git [best practices](https://github.com/smonette/fed-resources#git)
4. Search for articles about how to write a good readme


## Things to consider
- What choices can you make that will allow this to work on all devices?
- How is Sass different than CSS? And, how can you use this functionality to make coding easier?
- Is there a way to deploy your site within Github itself?
