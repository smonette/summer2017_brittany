# Hey Brittany!

We're happy to have you joining us this summer! Here's a repo of mimi-projects you can work on whenever you hit some downtime. I'll add more as the summer continues.


## Goals

### By the end of summer 2017 my hope is that you will:

  * Feel confident and capable as an HTML/CSS developer.
  * Feel comfortable working in a collaborative version control process. (Github)
  * Be excited to experiment with new tech.
  * Have real-world work to show in future interviews.
