# Hey Brittany!

We're happy to have you joining us this summer! If you have some downtime, I'll add some front-end exercises that you can do to practice.


## Goals

### By the end of summer 2017 my hope is that you will:

  * Feel confident and capable as an HTML/CSS developer.
  * Feel comfortable working in a collaborative version control process. (Github)
  * Be excited to experiment with new tech.
  * Have real-world work to show in future interviews.
